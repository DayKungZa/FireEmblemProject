## This is the Fire Emblem Project
from ESC776: Into the complex world

# Introduction
If you have played one of the Fire Emblem games, you might know that the battle mechanic relies not only on strategy but on luck too.
With each battle initiated, HIT, CRIT, and DMG are displayed for you. Even if your character is strong, they might miss an attack--or even get hit by a critical too.
So with the school project task of making Monte-Carlo simulation, a method using a lot of random number to simulate, and turn that into statistics, I decided that Fire Emblem is the game I want to use.
This project uses the Monte-Carlo method to simulate battles with characters from Fire Emblem Echoes to find the best character.
